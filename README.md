# share_link_button

QlikSense extension which enables the user to generate a link based on current selections. The user who creates the link has the ability to automatically route users to a different application and make selections OR use the copied link for distribution.

This extension is a remix of the (Linkup)[https://github.com/balexbyrd/LinkUp] extension built by Alex Byrd and includes a bunch more style and useability features.
